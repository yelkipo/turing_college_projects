# 📊 Coursera Course Data Analysis

This project is the final assignment for the **Data Visualization with Python Sprint**. It uses the **Coursera Course Dataset** to explore trends, generate insights, and practice visualizing data using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly Express**.

> The project was conducted using **Jupyter Notebook in VS Code**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Practice working with data from Kaggle.
- Perform basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Visualize data with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express.
- Read, query, and filter data using Pandas.

---

## 📦 Dataset Description

The dataset contains **890 Coursera courses** and includes the following columns:

- `course_title` – Title of the course  
- `course_organization` – Organization offering the course  
- `course_Certificate_type` – Type of certificate awarded  
- `course_rating` – Course rating (0–5 scale)  
- `course_difficulty` – Course difficulty level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate)  
- `course_students_enrolled` – Number of students enrolled  

---

## 🧪 Main Hypotheses Tested

1. Higher-rated courses have more students.
2. Beginner-level courses attract more students.
3. Certain course types are more popular.

---

## 📊 Visualizations Used

- Scatter plots
- Bar charts (horizontal & vertical)
- Histograms
- Grouped comparisons by category
- Correlation heatmaps

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **pandas** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **matplotlib & seaborn** – Traditional static visualizations  
- **plotly express** – Interactive charts for better insights  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Beginner courses** dominate in both volume and popularity.
- **High ratings** do not always guarantee high enrollment.
- Courses offering **verified certificates** tend to have higher average enrollments.
- A few **organizations** contribute a large number of courses on the platform.
